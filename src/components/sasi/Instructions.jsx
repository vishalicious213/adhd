            <h1>Women's ADHD Self-Assessment Symptom Inventory (SASI)</h1>
            <p className='text italics'>The following set of self-assessment questions has been developed informally, over time, reflecting the authorsâ€™ clinical experience in treating women and girls with AD/HD. Normative data has not yet been collected using this inventory, either to compare women diagnosed with AD/HD with undiagnosed women, or to compare responses of men and women diagnosed with AD/HD. Such studies, however, would both provide valuable information and lend greater validity to this inventory as a diagnostic tool.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            Some of the items included in the Inventory reflect issues more typical of women with Combined Type AD/HD, while others are representative of women with Primarily Inattentive Type AD/HD. At present, the following questions are appropriate for use as a detailed, structured self-assessment of a broad range of concerns typically reported by women with AD/HD. The authors hope that this Self-Assessment Symptom Inventory will prove to be an important step in the process of exploring important gender differences in adult AD/HD and developing a consensus on more gender and age-appropriate diagnostic criteria for women.</p>
            <p className="text italics">(This scale should not be used for diagnostic purposes. Instead, results should be considered as part of a structured interview, and used in conjunction with diagnostic testing when evaluating women for possible AD/HD.)</p>
